*Have you ever asked yourself:*  
> "Can a low-spec mini PC really run all those self-hosted services?"

That's what I asked myself. I was super skeptical, but curiosity got the best of me.


## 🧬 What's IRMLabs?

Before we dive in, quick note on the name: **IRMLabs**.

Why "IRMLabs"?  
As we all know (IYKYK), I’m a fan of *Genshin Impact*.
There’s this concept in the game called Irminsul. Basically, a big magical cosmic tree that stores all knowledge ever. Like, literally everything. Memories, history, forgotten lore, probably even our embarrassing Google searches :v.

And for some reason, that idea really stuck with me. I mean, imagine having a place where you can dump all your ideas, notes, random thoughts at 2AM, and later actually find them again. That’s the dream, right?.

So I thought, hey, why not make my own version?
I took the first three letters of Irminsul "IRM" and turned it into something that sounds slightly cooler (i think): "IRMLabs".

IRMLabs isn't a high-tech facility with glowing tubes and scientists in lab coats yet (hope it really involved like Tethys system).
But it is where I collect knowledge, make digital experiments, and pretend I know what I’m doing :3.

Maybe it’s a bit of a stretch, but I like to think of IRM also standing for:

## 🧰 The Humble Hardware

I started with what I already had lying around, a secondhand **Lenovo ThinkCentre m910q mini PC**:

- 🧠 **CPU**: Intel Core i3-7132K  
- 🧵 **RAM**: 8GB DDR4  
- 💾 **Storage**: 128GB SSD  
- 🔌 **Network**: Wired LAN, directly connected to router  
- 🧊 **Cooling**: Tiny stock fan, surprisingly quiet

No GPU, no RAID, no fancy NAS. Just an old machine that was too good to throw away.

> *“Bro… 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD for a server?!”*

## 🌀 Why Even Bother?

Initially? Pure curiosity.  
I kept seeing people on Youtube running self-hosted setups on Raspberry Pis or low-power boxes. I thought:

> *“Is it really worth trying this on my old mini PC? Can it even handle Docker containers without crying?”*

So I installed **Ubuntu Server**, slapped **Docker + Portainer** on top, and started deploying.


## ⚙️ What It’s Running Now

Surprisingly… quite a lot.  
I’ve got over **28 containers** running (for now), including:

- Dify (for LLM / AI backend)
- Nextcloud (personal cloud)
- Grafana + Prometheus (monitoring)
- Jenkins (CI/CD)
- n8n (automation)
- WireGuard + Tailscale (VPN)
- WikiJS + Logseq
- Minio (S3 storage)
- Vaultwarden (password manager)
- Dashy (homelab dashboard)
- Audiobookshelf, Kavita, Navidrome, Uptime Kuma, and more

And the wild part?  
**It’s still responsive. RAM usage is decent. CPU load is chill, as long as I don't develop directly on the server.💀**

But I was shocked... okay maybe not that shocked.

## 🧪 So, What I’ve Learned

- You don’t need a monster rig to get started.
- Docker + Portainer makes life **way easier**.
- Mini PCs are perfect low-power homelab machines.
- Don’t underestimate what Linux + containers can do, you can build your own open-source alternative to AWS, Spotify, even Netflix.
## 📌 TL;DR

> A secondhand mini PC turned into a legit homelab server with 28+ containers, a custom domain, and endless fun.

If you're sitting on an old ThinkCentre or NUC — try it.  
Worst case? You reinstall Windows.  
Best case? You turn that old box into something surprisingly useful.🧠✨
