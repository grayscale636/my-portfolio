## Overview

This project explores the use of Neural Style Transfer (NST) to generate new and artistic variations of traditional Indonesian batik patterns. Combining computer vision, deep learning, and cultural heritage, the project focuses on building a system that merges different batik styles to create entirely new motifs.

## Key Features

- **Dataset Blending**: Combined personal batik collections and open-source images (e.g., from Kaggle) to build a diverse style-content dataset.
- **NST Pipeline**: Developed a modular pipeline that applies neural style transfer between selected batik content and style images.
- **Model Experimentation**: Evaluated and compared the artistic output of various convolutional neural networks, including fine-tuned VGG19, ResNet50, and InceptionV3.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conducted controlled experiments on learning rate, content/style weight ratios, and layer activation maps to optimize motif quality.
- **Result Visualization**: Created detailed visual comparisons for each model and configuration, aiding both artistic evaluation and scientific analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow, Keras**: For building and training NST models.
- **Matplotlib & OpenCV**: For image preprocessing and result visualization.
- **VGG19, ResNet50, InceptionV3**: For feature extraction and stylization.
- **Python, NumPy**: For data handling and experimentation scripts.

## Challenges and Learnings

Balancing artistic quality with model performance was a key challenge, especially in maintaining the integrity of traditional batik forms while introducing new styles. Handling overfitting in fine-tuned CNNs also required careful tuning. The project offered deep insight into how neural networks interpret visual features and how style can be mathematically transferred across images.

## Outcome

This research contributed to a journal publication under **ALife Robotics Inc (2025)** and demonstrated a novel application of deep learning in preserving and evolving cultural heritage. The project offers a proof-of-concept for combining AI with art and opens potential pathways for automated design tools in fashion and textiles.
